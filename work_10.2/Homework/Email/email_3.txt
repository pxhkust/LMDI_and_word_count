Summary: Hidden issues of Canvas
Summary details:
Dear Sir or Madam,

I am CHEN, Peixiu, TA for ENVR3004, I am wondering why I have hidden the scores from Homework #1 but only two students finally hidden. Other students still can see their own scores from in the Canvas. How I can hide all the scores before I manually release?

Thank you for your support and I really appreciate. Thank you very much.

Best wishes,
Peixiu
