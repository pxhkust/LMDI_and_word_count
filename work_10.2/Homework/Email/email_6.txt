External Data
You may use data other than the dataset to develop and test your submission. However, please ensure that the external data is publicly available and accessible to use by all participants of the Challenge for the purposes of the Challenge at no cost to the other participants.

Inspiration
Here are some ideas for the data analysis:
•                                   Perform sentiment analysis on the text data.
•                                   Predict the number of comments, likes/dislikes, reactions, shares, and views a post will have based on its title/keywords/pubdate.
•                                   Is the amount of news coverage and social media postings predictive of certain social or business trends?
•                                   Analyze the change in economic activities as a result of the pandemic, such as discounts, online shopping, delivery, entertainment, and so on.
•                                   Analyze the discussion trends related to the vaccines and the government’s vaccination programme.
